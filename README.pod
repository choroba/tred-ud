=head1 NAME

ud - TrEd extension to display and edit Universal Dependencies

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 2

=item *

Dropping node C<a> on node C<b> attaches node C<a> to node C<b>. An enhanced
dependency is created together with the basic one, if an enhanced dependency
existed to the old or new parent, it is removed.

=item *

Dropping node C<a> on node C<b> while pressing C<Control> toggles existence of
an enhanced dependency of node C<a> on node C<b>. If a dependency was created,
the user is asked for its type. This works even when C<a> already is C<b>'s
parent.

=item *

Dropping node C<a> on node C<b> while pressing C<Shift> attaches node C<a> to
node C<b> without creating an enhanced dependency. If an enhanced dependency
existed to the old or new parent, it is removed.

=item *

Pressing C<d> opens a dialog box to edit the current node's dependency type.
If previously an enhanced dependency of the same type as the basic dependency
existed, it is changed together with it, otherwise, it stays unchanged.

=item *

Pressing C<l>, C<f>, and C<p> edits lemma, features, and POS, respectively.

=head1 INSTALLATION
